Dambanang Bayan Co-operative System (DBCS)

A Community Development Co-operative (CDC) is the basis for the community's economic empowerment and sustainability. The CDC is made up of a community's residents, businesses, institutions, and associations. I created a system for a CDC client (Dambanang Bayan Co-operative System) with the following modules:

- Membership Management
- Savings
- Capital Share
- Time Deposit
- Pension Plan
- College Insurance Plan
- Loan
- Death Aid Funds
- Mutual Aid Funds
- Dividend Distributions
- Reports
